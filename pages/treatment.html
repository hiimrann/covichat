          <ul>

            <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing or shows symptoms of Covid-19</li>
            <li>Wear a mask while going outside</li>
            <li>Donâ€™t touch eyes, nose or mouth</li>
            <li>Cover nose and mouth with a bent elbow or a tissue while coughing or sneezing</li>
            <li>Stay home if feeling unwell</li>
            <li>If a fever, cough and difficulty breathing is being noticed, seek medical attention immediately</li>
          </ul>
